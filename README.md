# Web Developer | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Problem Solver🚀
## About Me👨‍💻 
Coming from a Mechanical Engineering background at NIT Silchar, I have always been curious about solving problems and building things. While my degree shaped my analytical thinking, my passion led me to Software Development and AI. Despite not having a formal CS degree, I dived deep into MERN Stack Development, Machine Learning, and Data Structures & Algorithms, proving that dedication and skill matter more than background.

From mastering React.js in my internship at Get Your Homes, where I built an interactive, real-time dashboard, to developing AI-powered applications from scratch, I have continuously pushed my limits and thrived in the tech world. My journey is a testament that curiosity and consistency can break any boundaries.
