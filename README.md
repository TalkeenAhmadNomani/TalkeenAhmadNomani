# I am Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast || Problem Solver

I am a results-oriented Data Science professional with a strong command of Data Structures and Algorithms, which enables me to write optimized and efficient code for real-world applications. My expertise spans across machine learning, statistical analysis, and building scalable data pipelines using Python, MongoDB, and cloud platforms like AWS.

I have successfully implemented end-to-end ML workflows involving data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, and deployment with MLOps practices including Docker, GitHub Actions, and EC2. I am also proficient in working with large datasets and deriving actionable insights through data-driven decision-making.

My strengths lie in analytical thinking, clean code practices, and the ability to quickly adapt to new tools and technologies. Iâ€™m eager to bring this blend of data science expertise and algorithmic problem-solving into a dynamic team to build impactful solutions.
